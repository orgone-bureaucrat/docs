## Overview

Kisuke Connect is a secure networking layer that connects your mobile device to your computers and servers. Think of it like Tailscale - it creates an encrypted mesh network between all your devices.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Phone     │     │   Laptop    │     │   Server    │
│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │◄───►│   Kisuke    │
│             │     │   Connect   │     │   Connect   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                   │                   │
       └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                    Encrypted Mesh
```

When you sign in to Kisuke with the same account on multiple devices:

1. Each device gets a unique cryptographic identity
2. Devices discover each other through Kisuke's coordination servers
3. Direct encrypted connections are established when possible
4. Traffic flows directly between devices (no middleman)

## Key Benefits

### Zero Configuration

Just sign in on both devices and they find each other automatically. No port forwarding, no firewall rules, no VPN setup.

### End-to-End Encryption

All traffic between your devices is encrypted. Kisuke servers cannot read your data - they only help devices find each other.

### Works Anywhere

Kisuke Connect works through:
- Home networks
- Corporate firewalls
- Mobile data
- Coffee shop WiFi

### NAT Traversal

Kisuke Connect uses modern NAT traversal techniques to establish direct connections even when both devices are behind firewalls.

## Connection Types

### Direct Connection

The preferred mode. Devices communicate directly over the internet:

```
Phone ◄────── Encrypted ──────► Computer
              Direct Path
```

### Relayed Connection

When direct connection isn't possible (strict firewalls, carrier-grade NAT), traffic goes through Kisuke relay servers:

```
Phone ◄──── Encrypted ────► Relay ◄──── Encrypted ────► Computer
```

<Note>
Even relayed traffic is end-to-end encrypted. Relay servers can't read your data.
</Note>

## Device Management

View and manage your connected devices in the Kisuke app:

- **Devices list** - See all devices on your account
- **Connection status** - Check if devices are online
- **Remove devices** - Revoke access to old devices

## Authentication

Kisuke Connect uses your identity provider for authentication:

- **Claude** (Anthropic)
- **Google**
- **OpenAI**

This means:
- No separate passwords
- Your provider's security (2FA, etc.) protects your network
- Single sign-on across devices

## Use Cases

### Remote Development

Access your development machine from anywhere. Run builds, edit code, and use terminals on your powerful desktop while coding from your phone.

### Server Access

Connect to servers in your home lab, cloud VMs, or office machines without exposing ports to the internet.

### File Transfer

Securely move files between devices without cloud storage.
