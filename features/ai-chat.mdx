## Features

### Code Context

When you're in a Space, the AI has access to:

- Your project files
- Recent terminal output
- Previous conversation history

This helps it give relevant, contextual answers.

### Code Generation

Ask the AI to write code:

```
"Write a Python function to parse CSV files"
"Create a React component for a login form"
"Generate SQL to find duplicate records"
```

### Debugging Help

Share errors and get solutions:

```
"Why am I getting this error: [paste error]"
"My API call returns 403, what could be wrong?"
"This function returns undefined, help me debug"
```

### Code Explanation

Understand unfamiliar code:

```
"Explain what this regex does: ^[a-zA-Z0-9+_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$"
"Walk me through this algorithm"
"What does this SQL query do?"
```

### Quick Actions

- **Refactor** - Improve code structure
- **Document** - Add comments and docs
- **Test** - Generate unit tests
- **Convert** - Translate between languages

## Chat Interface

## Tips

### Be Specific

More detail = better answers:

```
❌ "Fix my code"
✅ "My React useEffect runs infinitely. Here's my component: [code]. How do I fix the dependency array?"
```

### Share Context

Include relevant files or errors:

```
"Looking at src/utils/parser.js, can you optimize the parse function?"
```

### Follow Up

Continue the conversation to refine answers:

```
"That works, but can you make it handle null values?"
```
