## Overview

Spaces help you organize your coding projects in Kisuke. Each space is a self-contained workspace with its own files, terminal sessions, and AI context.

## Creating a Space

1. Open Kisuke
2. Tap **Spaces** in the bottom navigation
3. Tap **+ New Space**
4. Choose a name and location

## Space Types

### Local Space

A space on your mobile device:

- Files stored locally
- Works offline
- Limited by device storage

### Connected Space

A space on a connected computer or server:

- Files on remote machine
- Requires active connection
- Access your full development environment

## Working with Spaces

### Switching Spaces

Tap the space name at the top of the screen to switch between spaces.

### Space Contents

Each space contains:

- **Files** - Project files and folders
- **Terminal** - Shell sessions for this workspace
- **Chat** - AI conversation history with project context

### Project Detection

Kisuke automatically detects project types:

- Node.js (package.json)
- Python (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Rust (Cargo.toml)
- Go (go.mod)
- And more...

## AI Context

When you chat with AI in a space, it has context about:

- Your project structure
- Recent file changes
- Terminal history
- Previous conversations

This helps the AI give more relevant suggestions.

## Syncing

Spaces on connected devices sync automatically:

- File changes appear immediately
- Terminal output streams in real-time
- Chat history is preserved

## Best Practices

### One Space Per Project

Keep things organized by creating a separate space for each project you're working on.

### Use Connected Spaces for Heavy Work

For large projects or resource-intensive tasks, use connected spaces on your computer.

### Local Spaces for Quick Edits

Local spaces are great for quick scripts, notes, or experimenting.
