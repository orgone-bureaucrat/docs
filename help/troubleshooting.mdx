## Connection Issues

### Devices Not Appearing

**Problem**: Your devices don't see each other in the Devices list.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check account** - Ensure both devices are signed into the same account
2. **Check network** - Both devices need internet connectivity
3. **Check status** - Verify Kisuke Connect is running on your computer
4. **Restart** - Try restarting Kisuke on both devices

### Connection Drops Frequently

**Problem**: Connections are unstable.

**Solutions**:

1. **Network stability** - Check your internet connection
2. **Firewall** - Ensure UDP port 41641 isn't blocked
3. **Battery optimization** - Disable battery optimization for Kisuke on mobile
4. **Update** - Ensure you're running the latest version

### Slow Connection

**Problem**: Terminal or file operations are slow.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check relay** - You might be using a relay instead of direct connection
   - Go to **Connect** > **Devices** > tap device > check **Connection Type**
2. **Open ports** - Allow UDP 41641 for direct connections
3. **Closer relay** - If relayed, check you're connecting to the nearest relay

## Authentication Issues

### Can't Sign In

**Problem**: Sign in fails or loops.

**Solutions**:

1. **Browser** - Try a different browser
2. **Clear cache** - Clear browser cookies and cache
3. **Provider status** - Check if your auth provider (Claude/Google/OpenAI) is having issues
4. **Try again** - Sometimes OAuth just needs a retry

### Session Expired

**Problem**: You're being asked to sign in repeatedly.

**Solutions**:

1. **Re-authenticate** - Sign out and sign back in
2. **Check time** - Ensure your device clock is accurate
3. **Update app** - Update to the latest version

## Terminal Issues

### Terminal Not Connecting

**Problem**: Can't open a terminal session to a connected device.

**Solutions**:

1. **Device online** - Verify the target device is connected
2. **Shell access** - Check that the user has shell access on the target
3. **Permissions** - On Linux/Mac, verify your user can access the shell

### Terminal Freezes

**Problem**: Terminal becomes unresponsive.

**Solutions**:

1. **Interrupt** - Try Ctrl+C
2. **New session** - Close and open a new terminal
3. **Connection** - Check if the connection is still active

### Keys Not Working

**Problem**: Special keys (Tab, Ctrl, etc.) don't work.

**Solutions**:

1. **Keyboard mode** - Ensure you're using Kisuke's keyboard, not system keyboard
2. **Gestures** - Try using gestures (swipe for Ctrl+C, etc.)
3. **External keyboard** - Connect a Bluetooth keyboard

## File/Editor Issues

### Files Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes aren't being saved.

**Solutions**:

1. **Permissions** - Check file permissions on the target device
2. **Disk space** - Verify there's available disk space
3. **Connection** - Ensure the connection is active

### Syntax Highlighting Missing

**Problem**: Code isn't highlighted correctly.

**Solutions**:

1. **File extension** - Make sure the file has the correct extension
2. **Language detection** - Manually set the language in editor settings
